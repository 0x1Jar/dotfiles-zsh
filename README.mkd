# TomNomNom Dotfiles (Zsh Enhanced)

This is a collection of personal dotfiles, which have been customized for use with Zsh.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed the following software:

*   **Git**: To clone this repository and for Vim plugin management (Vundle).
*   **Zsh**: The shell that will be configured.
*   **Vim**: The text editor configured by `.vimrc` in these dotfiles.
*   **curl** or **wget**: Required if you plan to run the `go-setup.sh` script.

**Prerequisites Installation:**

*   **On macOS (using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):**
    ```bash
    brew install git zsh vim curl wget
    ```

*   **On Linux (example for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git zsh vim curl wget -y
    ```
    For other Linux distributions (e.g., Fedoria, Arch Linux), use the appropriate package manager (e.g., `dnf`, `pacman`).

## Dotfiles Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, for example `~/.dotfiles`:
    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/tomnomnom/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles](https://github.com/0x1Jar/dotfiles-zsh.git)
    ```
    If you are already in a directory that contains these dotfiles, you can skip this step.

2.  **Move to the Dotfiles Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```
    (Or the directory where you cloned/stored these dotfiles).

3.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    The `setup.sh` script will create the necessary symlinks for the configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, etc.) to your home directory and will install Vundle (a Vim plugin manager).
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    *Note: If you get a permission error, run `chmod +x setup.sh` first.*

4.  **Verify Vim Plugin Installation:**
    The `setup.sh` script attempts to install Vim plugins automatically. To verify or if there are issues, open Vim:
    ```bash
    vim
    ```
    Then run the following command within Vim:
    ```vim
    :PluginInstall
    ```
    Close Vim once the installation is complete (`:qa`).

## Go Installation (Optional)

If you need a Go development environment, you can use the `go-setup.sh` script. This script will download and install the Go version specified in it.

```bash
./go-setup.sh
```
*Note: This script uses `sudo` to move the Go files to `/usr/local/go`, so you might be prompted for a password.*
Make sure to check and possibly update the Go version in the `go-setup.sh` script to the latest version you want.

## Setting Zsh as the Default Shell

If Zsh is not already your default shell, you can change it with the following command:
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
You need to log out and log back in, or restart your system for this change to take full effect.

## Starting a New Zsh Session

Close your current terminal and open a new one to start using your new Zsh configuration. You can also try running `source ~/.zshrc` in the existing Zsh session, but starting a new session is the best way to make sure everything loads correctly.

## Additional Local Configuration

You can place additional personal configuration that you don't want to track in Git in the `~/.localrc` file. This file will be sourced automatically by `.zshrc` if it exists.

Enjoy your dotfiles configuration!
